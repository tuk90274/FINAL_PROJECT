        <p>Our mission statement is to help students stay organized and on top of their priorities. Through navigation, you'd find your very own reminder list. A page for you to stay organized and prioritize your academic schedule - setting reminders for assignments, tests, and other important deadlines in your agenda. Additionally, you'd also find yourself with important resources linked in the navigation bar alongside your <em>Reminder List: Priority Registration Dates</em>,<em> Canvas</em>, and<em> TU Portal</em>. These resources serve as a shortcut to access your canvas page, portal, as well as information about Spring 2021 priority registration dates&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;<em> &nbsp; &nbsp;</em></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Due to our current learning situation, all classes are currently being held virtually. With that being said, online learning can be very hectic and confusing for many students. We hope that this site would make your life easier and help you to stay ahead of your upcoming deadlines. Please take the advantage of this opportunity to save your notes and stay reminded of any important deadlines using Temple University's Student Planner.&nbsp;</p>
